          My Queen, the embodyment of  courage, compassion,
          and intellect, stands as my beacon of inspiration and admiration in this
          medieval English love confession. She was a muse for poets, a symbol of strength
          for warriors, and a gentle guiding light for those fortunate enough to
          cross her path. In the tapestry of medieval England, this woman, both
          captivating and hardworking, stood as a living testament to the
          timeless beauty that transcends the ages, leaving an indelible mark
          upon the hearts and minds of all who beheld her.{" "}And i shall end this not as medieval English but with Pidgin."Omo you de burst my head every day"
